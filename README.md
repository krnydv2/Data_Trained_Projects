# Titanic-Project
Linear Regression ML Model to predict the Salary

Problem Statement:
 The Titanic Problem is based on the sinking of the ‘Unsinkable’ ship Titanic in early 1912. It gives you information about multiple people like their ages, sexes, sibling counts, embarkment points, and whether or not they survived the disaster. Based on these features, you have to predict if an arbitrary passenger on Titanic would survive the sinking or not. 

Note: You can find the dataset in the link below.
